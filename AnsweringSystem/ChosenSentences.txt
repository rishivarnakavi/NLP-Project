Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005.
Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits".
Reddit's popularity is due to its simple format and size.
In early fall, huge bugs in the system cause Reddit to often shut down.
The spikes in productivity mean Reddit will stay relevant forever.
